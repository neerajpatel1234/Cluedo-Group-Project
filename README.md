# Cluedo-Group-Project

## Description 

This was a second-year university group project, we began with the creation of a text-based rendition of the classic family board game "Cluedo," and we delved into the fundamentals of programming logic and algorithm design. Implementing the core mechanics of the game, allowing players to play detective through the command line.

As we became more proficient in the Java programming language, our goals also expanded. After making the switch from a text-based prototype to an object-oriented Graphical User Interface (GUI), we set out to create a complete version of "Cluedo." This was a major advancement in our technical skills as it required us to grasp ideas like graphics rendering and event-driven programming.

We overcome several obstacles with commitment and persistence, honing our GUI implementation to provide a fluid and engaging gameplay experience. Text inputs were obsolete thanks to our GUI version, whichÂ highlighted the importance of its professional appearance and easy-to-use interface while offering interactive features and visual clues.
